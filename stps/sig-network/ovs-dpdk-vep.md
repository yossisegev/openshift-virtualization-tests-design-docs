- Also note that when not explicitly mentioned otherwise, the term "network plugin" refers to the OVS-DPDK network binding plugin.

### **Feature Overview**

Performance-intensive VM workloads require network throughput and latency that the standard Linux kernel stack cannot consistently deliver. OVS-DPDK (Open vSwitch with the DPDK data plane) addresses this by moving packet processing entirely to userspace, bypassing the kernel and achieving high-throughput, low-latency virtual networking performance. This STP covers the Tech Preview introduction of OVS-DPDK network support for OpenShift Virtualization VMs in OCP 5.1; live migration of VMs with OVS-DPDK network interfaces is also supported.

> **Note on TP testing scope:** Although this feature ships as Tech Preview in OCP 5.1, QE is providing full test coverage as an exceptional commitment to the target customer. This is not the standard TP testing approach.

### **I. Motivation and Requirements Review (QE Review Guidelines)**

#### **1. Requirement & User Story Review Checklist**

- [x] **Review Requirements**
  - *List the key D/S requirements reviewed:*
    - VM users can connect their VMs to the network through a high-throughput, low-latency interface.
    - VM users can live-migrate a VM that uses a high-throughput, low-latency interface.
    - A cluster admin can deploy and enable the components required to make this capability available.

- [x] **Understand Value and Customer Use Cases**
  - *Describe the feature's value to customers:* OVS-DPDK delivers wire-speed virtual networking for performance-intensive workloads by bypassing the kernel network stack, thus enabling to attach a high-performance network interface to VMs.
  - *List the customer use cases identified:*
    - As a VM owner, I would like to run a DPDK application in my VM by using OVS-DPDK network binding, to gain high-throughput and low-latency.
    - As a VM owner, I would like to be able to live-migrate an OVS-DPDK based VM.
    - As a cluster admin, I would like to enable DPDK network acceleration.

- [x] **Testability**
  - *Note any requirements that are unclear or untestable:* Core flows are testable. The OVS-DPDK DRA driver setup is applied at cluster deployment time (day-0; see CNV-96151 for the CI lane implementation tracking issue), so it will be eventually validated by the dedicated tests.

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria**
  - *List the acceptance criteria:*
    1. A VM with OVS DPDK network binding plugin starts successfully and has connectivity through the assigned device.
    2. A VM with OVS DPDK network binding plugin can be live-migrated (limited to binding using ResourceClaimTemplate); an active connection established before migration is maintained and restored after migration completes, and the VM is reachable on the destination node.
    3. VMs with OVS-DPDK network devices on a bridge configured with a non-default MTU can exchange traffic using the full jumbo-frame payload size, with no fragmentation.
    4. A VM with two OVS-DPDK network interfaces, each backed by a separate device-class request within the same ResourceClaim, starts successfully and has connectivity through both interfaces.
    5. Two VMs each requesting a device from a different OVS-DPDK device class can be co-scheduled on the same node and exchange traffic with each other.
  - *Note any gaps or missing criteria:* None for TP scope.

- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
  - *List applicable NFRs and their targets:*
    - Security: No new RBAC or authentication changes introduced; existing Kubernetes DRA access controls and webhook validations apply.
    - Scalability: No new scale requirements for TP phase; the feature follows the existing DRA scalability model from Kubernetes.
    - Monitoring/Observability: No new metrics or alerts required for TP phase.
    - UI: Feature is API-driven; no new UI components required. UI team confirmed no testing needed for TP.
    - Performance: No performance requirements defined for TP phase; performance validation is deferred to GA, and is anyway owned by the dedicated performance team and is outside this team's scope.
  - *Note any NFRs not covered and why:*
    - Portability (cloud): OVS-DPDK requires bare-metal; cloud platform testing is not applicable.

#### **2. Known Limitations**

- **Hot-plug/hot-unplug:** Adding or removing DRA-backed network interfaces on a running VM is not supported.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

- **ResourceClaim live migration:** Live migration is only supported for VMs whose backing driver devices were allocated via ResourceClaimTemplate. VMs using direct ResourceClaim-backed devices cannot be live-migrated, as ResourceClaim is a node-specific resource.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

- **Mixed network sources:** Mixing DRA and Multus-based network sources on the same VM is not supported.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

- **Multiple devices per claim:** Allocating multiple network devices via a single ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate (count > 1) has not been validated and is not a supported configuration.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

- **Interface link-state management:** Setting the interface link-state via the VM spec (`vm.spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces[].state`) is not supported for OVS-DPDK network devices.
  - *Sign-off:* [Name / @github-handle] / [Date]

#### **3. Technology and Design Review**

- [x] **Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff**
  - *Key takeaways and concerns:*
    - DRA replaces the traditional device-plugin approach: users describe the network device they need using Kubernetes resource claim objects (ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate), and the Kubernetes scheduler allocates devices with full awareness of device constraints and placement requirements.
    - Once the DRA driver provisions the device, a network binding plugin configures the VM's network interface. KubeVirt orchestrates between the DRA driver and the binding plugin.
    - A feature gate gates all new API surface; disabling the gate rejects any DRA network source at admission time.
    - Rollback from an enabled feature gate requires removing all VMs using DRA network devices before disabling the gate.

- [x] **Technology Challenges**
  - *List identified challenges:*
    - Testing requires a functional external OVS-DPDK DRA driver. Setting up OVS-DPDK as a DRA driver involves significant infrastructure configuration (hugepages, OVS configuration, DPDK-capable NICs or software equivalent).
    - The OVS-DPDK DRA driver setup is applied at cluster deployment time (day-0). This approach was selected to ensure environment consistency across test runs; see CNV-96151 for the CI lane implementation tracking issue.
    - The feature requires Kubernetes 1.34+ for exposing device metadata from the DRA driver to the containers that need it, and accessing it (as detailed in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/resource-management/dynamic-resource-allocation/dra-observability/#device-metadata). OCP 5.1, which is based on Kubernetes 1.37, meets this version requirement.
  - *Impact on testing approach:* Tests require a dedicated environment with the OVS-DPDK DRA driver deployed and validated before test execution. A standard shared CI lane is not suitable without driver setup; a dedicated CI lane is needed.

- [x] **API Extensions**
  - *List new or modified APIs:* A new DRA network source type is added to the VM network configuration API. Users reference their DRA resource claims from the VM spec using the new source type. A feature gate controls availability of this new source type.
  - *Testing impact:* Test scenarios cover both valid DRA network configurations and invalid ones (except for cases that are designed to be rejected by admission webhooks, which are covered in unit-tests). Existing tests for Multus-based networks are unaffected.

- [x] **Test Environment Needs**
  - *See environment requirements in Section II.3 and testing tools in Section II.3.1*

- [x] **Topology Considerations**
  - *Describe topology requirements:* All tests run on a bare-metal cluster (3-master/3-worker) with DPDK-capable physical NICs and IOMMU enabled on worker nodes. OVS-DPDK requires real hardware and cannot run on a virtualized cluster. Multi-node topology is required for live migration scenarios.
  - *Impact on test design:* All scenarios run on the bare-metal cluster. Live migration scenarios require at least two worker nodes, which the 3-worker topology satisfies.

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

**Testing Goals**

- **[P0]** Verify that a VM can be created with an OVS-DPDK backing network device driver (allocated via ResourceClaimTemplate) with a network binding plugin and establish connectivity through the assigned device.
- **[P0]** Verify that a VM with a ResourceClaimTemplate-backed OVS-DPDK DRA network device can be live-migrated between nodes with an active connection maintained or re-established after migration completes.
- **[P1]** Verify that a VM with two DRA-backed OVS-DPDK vhost-user interfaces (each from a separate ResourceClaimTemplate) can be created and traffic flows independently on each interface.
- **[P1]** Verify that when the OVS-DPDK backing driver is restarted, VMs with existing vhost-user ports remain functional and new VMs backed by the network device can be created.
- **[P1]** Verify that VMs with OVS-DPDK network binding plugin on a bridge with non-default MTU can send traffic with jumbo frames between each other, with no fragmentation.
- **[P1]** Verify that a VM with two OVS-DPDK network interfaces, each backed by a separate device-class request within the same ResourceClaim, starts successfully and has connectivity through both interfaces.
- **[P1]** Verify that two VMs each requesting a device from a different OVS-DPDK device class can be co-scheduled on the same node and exchange traffic with each other.
- **[P2]** Verify that VMs with OVS-DPDK network devices can be live-migrated with connectivity preserved after the OVS-DPDK backing driver has been restarted on both source and destination nodes.
- **[P2]** Verify that two VMs on different nodes, each allocated an OVS-DPDK-backing network device from the same DeviceClass via separate ResourceClaimTemplates, can start and communicate over their respective network interfaces.
- **[P2]** Verify that a VM with a ResourceClaimTemplate-backed network device driver remains functional after an OCP minor-version upgrade; connectivity is re-established after the upgrade completes.
- **[P2]** Verify that a VM with an OVS-DPDK network device retains connectivity after a guest reboot.

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

- **Performance benchmarking of OVS-DPDK throughput and latency**
  - *Rationale:* No performance requirements are defined for the TP phase; performance validation is deferred to GA, and is anyway owned by the dedicated performance team and is outside this team's scope.
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

- **Scheduling of non-DRA NUMA-aware plugin for OVS-DPDK resources**
  - *Rationale:* Exposing OVS-DPDK resources via the legacy device binding plugin for NUMA-aware pod/VM scheduling is a separate mechanism from DRA. It requires bare-metal with dual-NUMA nodes. This STP covers DRA-based device consumption only.
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

- **Live migration failure path - the destination node cannot allocate the OVS-DPDK device required by the ResourceClaimTemplate**
  - *Rationale:* The nodes configuration is set on deployment time and not changed on day-2, and is similar on all nodes. This STP covers scenarios under the assumption of fixed, similar nodes configurations.
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-08

**Test Limitations**

- **DPDK applications inside VMs:** Running DPDK workloads inside a VM (vfio passthrough of the vhost-user device) requires vIOMMU and hugepages, hence testing is limited to QE bare-metal clusters.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

#### **2. Test Strategy**

**Functional**

- [x] **Functional Testing** — Validates that the feature works according to specified requirements and user stories
  - *Details:* Validate VM creation with OVS-DPDK network devices (via RC and RCT), connectivity establishment, and live migration with RCT-backed devices.

- [x] **Automation Testing** — Confirms test automation plan is in place for CI and regression coverage (all tests are expected to be automated)
  - *Details:* All new test scenarios will be automated. A dedicated CI lane is required due to OVS-DPDK hardware and driver setup requirements; the standard shared lane cannot be used without driver setup (see Section II.3.1).

- [x] **Regression Testing** — Verifies that new changes do not break existing functionality
  - *Details:* Existing secondary network and live migration test suites run as regression to confirm no impact from the new DRA network source type. Enabling the feature gate must not affect existing VMs using Multus-based networks.

- [ ] **Self-Validation Testing** — Should any of the new tests be included in the self-validation test package?
  - *Details:* Not applicable. DRA network device tests require a dedicated OVS-DPDK driver setup and special hardware; they are not suitable for the self-validation package.

**Non-Functional**

- [ ] **Performance Testing** — Validates feature performance meets requirements (latency, throughput, resource usage)
  - *Details:* Not applicable for TP phase; no performance requirements defined. Deferred to GA.

- [ ] **Scale Testing** — Validates feature behavior under increased load and at production-like scale
  - *Details:* Not applicable for TP phase; no scale requirements defined. The feature follows the existing DRA scalability model.

- [ ] **Security Testing** — Verifies security requirements, RBAC, authentication, authorization, and vulnerability scanning
  - *Details:* Not applicable; no new RBAC or authentication changes introduced. Webhook admission validation for invalid DRA network configurations is covered by unit tests in the KubeVirt codebase (see [CNV-97357](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/CNV-97357)).

- [ ] **Usability Testing** — Validates user experience and accessibility requirements
  - *Details:* Not applicable. Feature is API-driven; no new UI components or CLI commands introduced. UI team confirmed no testing required for TP phase.

- [ ] **Monitoring** — Does the feature require metrics and/or alerts?
  - *Details:* Not applicable for TP phase; no new metrics or alerts introduced.

**Integration & Compatibility**

- [x] **Compatibility Testing** — Ensures feature works across supported platforms, versions, and configurations
  - *Details:* Validate that the feature gate can be toggled between enabled and disabled. Existing Multus-based VM tests run as regression to confirm no impact from enabling the feature gate.

- [x] **Upgrade Testing** — Validates upgrade paths from previous versions (starting from 5.1), data migration, and configuration preservation
  - *Details:* Validate that a VM with an RCT-backed network device remains functional after an OCP minor-version upgrade with connectivity re-established after the upgrade (see P2 testing goal).

- [x] **Dependencies** — Blocked by deliverables from other components/products
  - *Details:* Testing depends on a stable external OVS-DPDK DRA driver being available for QE use. Network binding plugin must be registered and functional before test execution begins. OVS must function properly as the base for OVS DPDK. Track driver and binding plugin readiness against the CNV-88618 epic.

- [x] **Cross Integrations** — Does the feature affect other features or require testing by other teams?
  - *Details:* The integration is with the DRA device, the coverage suggested in this STP will cover that (by the network team). The live migration flow is affected and will also be covered by the network tests; any regressions in VM scheduling or migration with DRA devices must be caught during testing.

**Infrastructure**

- [ ] **Cloud Testing** — Does the feature require multi-cloud platform testing?
  - *Details:* Not applicable. OVS-DPDK requires bare-metal; cloud platforms are not supported for this feature.

#### **3. Test Environment**

**Environment — Bare-metal cluster (all tests)**

- **Cluster Topology:** 3-master/3-worker bare-metal cluster (either HA or compact); multi-node worker topology required for live migration scenarios
- **OCP & OpenShift Virtualization Version(s):** OCP 5.1 with OpenShift Virtualization 5.1 (assures Kubernetes server version ≥ 1.34)
- **CPU:** Hardware virtualization enabled (VT-x / AMD-V); IOMMU enabled (VT-d / AMD-Vi) on all worker nodes
- **Compute Resources:** Minimum per worker node: 32 physical CPUs, 64 GB RAM; hugepages configured for OVS-DPDK
- **Special Hardware:** DPDK-capable physical NICs on worker nodes; dual-NUMA node topology available on workers
- **Storage:** ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization (ReadWriteMany access mode, Block volume mode — required for live-migration scenarios)
- **Network:** OVN-Kubernetes, IPv4; OVS-DPDK configured as a DRA network device on worker nodes
- **Required Operators:** N/A
- **Platform:** Bare-metal
- **Special Configurations:** OVS-DPDK DRA driver deployed and configured on worker nodes at cluster provisioning time (day-0; see CNV-96151); `NetworkDevicesWithDRA` feature gate enabled; network binding plugin registered in the HyperConverged CR.
- **Not suitable for:** Cloud platforms (OVS-DPDK requires bare-metal hardware).

#### **3.1. Testing Tools & Frameworks**

- **Test Framework:** Standard

- **CI/CD:** Dedicated CI lane required — OVS-DPDK DRA driver setup cannot be assumed in standard shared lanes

- **Other Tools:** OVS-DPDK DRA driver (external dependency)

#### **4. Entry Criteria**

The following conditions must be met before testing can begin:

- [ ] Requirements and design documents are **approved and merged**
- [ ] OCP 5.1 version confirmed (which necessarily assures Kubernetes server version ≥ 1.34)
- [ ] Test environment is **set up and configured** with OVS-DPDK DRA driver deployed and functional (see Section II.3)
- [ ] `NetworkDevicesWithDRA` feature gate is available and can be toggled in the test cluster
- [ ] Network binding plugin is registered for the OVS-DPDK device type in the HCO CR

#### **5. Risks**

**Timeline/Schedule**

- **Risk:** The OVS-DPDK DRA driver and test environment setup are complex and require cross-team coordination.
  - **Mitigation:** The setup approach (day-0) has been decided; CI lane implementation is tracked under [CNV-96151](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/CNV-96151).
  - *Estimated impact on schedule:* N/A — decision resolved.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

**Test Coverage**

- **Risk:** Testing is scoped to OVS-DPDK as the only concrete DRA network driver for this release. Other DRA network drivers, if introduced in future releases, will require separate test coverage.
  - **Mitigation:** Design test assertions against user-observable outcomes (connectivity, migration success) rather than OVS-DPDK-specific internals, so tests remain applicable to future drivers.
  - *Areas with reduced coverage:* Any DRA network driver type other than OVS-DPDK.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

**Test Environment**

- **Risk:** The bare-metal cluster requires DPDK-capable physical NICs, IOMMU, and hugepages configuration. Environment provisioning is complex and depends on infrastructure team support and hardware availability.
  - **Mitigation:** Environment setup is treated as a day-0 activity tracked under CNV-96151. Hardware requirements are documented explicitly so provisioning can start early.
  - *Missing resources or infrastructure:* Bare-metal cluster with DPDK-capable NICs required; tracked under CNV-96151.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

**Resource Constraints**

- **Risk:** Setting up and maintaining the OVS-DPDK DRA driver configuration on the bare-metal cluster requires cross-team expertise spanning OVS-DPDK and KubeVirt DRA. Insufficient expertise within QE may slow environment setup and test development.
  - **Mitigation:** Coordinate with the DevOps team for environment setup assistance during the initial test development phase. Document the setup procedure (ODC/ODRP configuration, driver deployment) to reduce ongoing dependency.
  - *Current capacity gaps:* OVS-DPDK DRA driver operational expertise within QE.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06

**Dependencies**

- **Risk:** Test execution depends on a stable and functional external OVS-DPDK DRA driver being available for QE use. If the driver is not ready or stable, all DRA network device test scenarios are blocked.
  - **Mitigation:** Track driver readiness against the CNV-88618 epic; do not begin test execution until the driver is confirmed stable for QE use. Coordinate with the DRA driver team for early access to a test build.
  - *Dependent teams or components:* OVS-DPDK DRA driver team; network binding plugin team; KubeVirt DRA core team.
  - *Sign-off:* Ronen Sde-Or / 2026-Sep-06
